in addition expanding scope aging clocks  neural networks used generate synthetic data large volumes  generative adversarial networks  gans   popular new machine learning technique first introduced ian goodfellow    commonly used drug discovery     enable generation biologically relevant synthetic data specified conditions  for
instance  breast cancer detection requires large number labeled mammograms train convolutional neural network  cnn   generally  kind requirement infeasible collection medicinal images especially mammographic tumor images  hence  generation synthetic data proposed possibility make cnn classifier perform better     synthesizing new patient data using gans trained millions samples  using age generation condition  allows massive anonymization data maintaining biologically relevant features 
as ideal augmentation method  gans give comprehensive application medical biological field  also enables identification potential targets driving aging disease related processes     many diseases related aging diagnosed using multiple omics data sets different dimensions including transcriptomics data  usually used targets identification process  recently  universal transcriptomic signature age performed caenorhabditis elegans identified handful molecules extend   mean lifespan     combining synthetic data different age various data sets provides novel approach create aging clock model pathogenic aging  related targets identified
