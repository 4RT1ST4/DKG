the pillars aging
attempts define causes aging impeded complexity phenotype coupled costs duration longevity studies  recently  progress accelerated  bringing geroscience forefront  first  invertebrate models identified conserved molecular pathways impacting aging  second  mammalian studies generated detailed understanding age associated pathologic changes  third  several interventions extend lifespan also improve aspects healthspan long lived mutants often resistant age related chronic diseases  finally urgently  global population aging looming  dire economic societal impacts  life expectancy continues rise  healthspan keeping pace current disease treatment often decreases mortality without preventing reversing decline overall health  elders sick longer  often coping multiple chronic diseases simultaneously  thus  urgent need extend healthspan 
key themes emerged regarding processes promote aging  recent reviews describing overlapping sets   processes  lopez otin et al     mahmoudi brunet     seven pillars discussed recent summit  figure    specific recommendations pillar emerged  table    but  importantly  connectedness striking  themes seven independent factors driving aging  rather highly intertwined processes  understanding interplay seven pillars critical

the mouse emerged primary mammalian model understand aging disease  mice develop pathologies approximating human aging  others modeled transgenic genome editing approaches  are  however  concerns validity mouse models  since preclinical studies often identify therapeutics fail humans  given mouse studies provide much evidence delayed aging  pro longevity interventions extend healthspan may also achieve human validation  yet  key difference aging studies many disease models aging studied normal mice species  therefore evolutionarily conserved interventions identified cut across species 
focus three areas may improve consistency mice humans  first  mouse studies generally fail use aged mice   human chronic diseases rise age  yet murine models invoke pathology young mice  aging creates distinctive systemic milieu  drugs show efficacy young may work aged  therefore  aging incorporated animal chronic disease models  recommendation increasing time cost  also likely yielding results translate accurately humans  thus providing long term savings 
a second goal employ whenever possible genetically outbred lines introduce natural population variation  better mimicking human diversity  third incorporate mild stress mouse studies accurately reflect human condition  stresses include low level chronic stress  including psychological sources  many animal studies use acute stresses experienced humans  also essential distinguish stresses induce hormetic response  protecting later acute stress  unconditionally deleterious 
while aging promotes disease  new findings suggest reciprocal may also true  diseases and or treatments may accelerate aging pathologies  instance  long term cytomegalovirus  cmv  infection induce chronic inflammation exhaust adaptive immune response  accelerating unrelated age associated pathologies  pawelec et al      also observed human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  patients  attributable either virus induced inflammation or  ironically  treatment modalities  pathai et al      similarly  children subjected chemotherapies often present accelerated aging features decades later  robison hudson     findings highlight relationships disease aging  calling thorough analysis humans animal models 
expand interventions extend lifespan healthspan
mammalian lifespan  also healthspan  modified dietary  genetic  pharmacologic interventions  several drugs reported extend mouse lifespan healthspan  kennedy pennypacker     raising possibility human aging delayed  obstacles exist  repertoire aging interventions greatly expanded  instance  dietary restriction long known extend rodent lifespan  though easily adapted humans  understanding links diet aging  well approaches like intermittent fasting  may yield practical strategies  moreover  given that

exciting findings demonstrated aging rodents accelerated  stalled reversed simply altering systemic environment  rando wyss coray     findings initially spotlighted heterochronic parabiosis experiments  circulation old young mice coupled  recent findings multiple labs indicate hallmarks aging modulated circulatory factors  beginning identified  growing line inquiry may offer tractable routes extend healthspan 
rapamycin first drug shown robustly extend mouse lifespan  johnson et al      finding repeated different backgrounds  also increases healthspan studies protective many age related disease models  drugs  including metformin acarbose  also extend mouse lifespan  harrison et al     martin montalvo et al      continued efforts directed identifying optimizing new molecules properties  understanding already identified  kennedy pennypacker     ultimately  drug combinations may optimal  further  many aging drugs approved single chronic disease  e g  metformin  rapamycin  may efficacy target basic aspects aging  therefore  thorough analysis drugs clinically approved chronic diseases performed identify potential increase healthspan 
elaborate environmental stochastic factors driving aging
conserved longevity pathways identified across disparate eukaryotic species  however  aging also depends environmental factors  may modifiable  yet  specific environmental influences aging  aside obvious culprits smoking obesity  remain poorly understood  moreover  stochasticity plays major role aging processes  enormous variability longevity traits among genetically identical individuals across species tested  causes stochasticity role aging age related diseases remain poorly understood

human genome association studies identified aging associated gene variations either genome wide unbiased gene targeted studies  examining orthologs animal aging genes  deelen et al      working mouse human genetics accelerate identification human aging genes mechanisms  strategies include generating orthologous identical human mutant alleles mice  modeling rare variants genes conserved longevity pathways 
the lack validated molecular biomarkers human aging impeded progress  however  recent studies uncovered promising candidates validated could used test interventions  epigenetic studies among exciting  reports indicating human age predicted analyzing dna methylation status  remains unclear whether markers forecast chronologic biologic age  likely distinct  indeed measure biologic age  major hurdle initiating human studies overcome  also  similar dna methylation sites identified mice  could validated determining whether interventions rapamycin delay appearance aging profile whether chronic stressors accelerate it  avenues molecular biomarkers  including metabolomic proteomic approaches  also yielding promising candidates deserve equal attention
