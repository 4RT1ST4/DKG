historical perspective medical research
due enormous complexity human biology  medical research historically obeyed reductionist strategy  attempts explain complex phenomena defining functional properties individual elements make system  thus  research focus went progressively organism whole  anatomy   organs  physiology   cells  cellular biology  and  recently  molecules  genes  proteins  lipids metabolites  p  sobradillo et al   arch bronconeumol       
molecular biology   reductionist strategy assumes world surrounds us understood terms properties constituting parts decomposing nature simplest parts laws  focus could defined divide conquer based assumption complex problems resolved dividing smaller  simpler problems therefore manageable  reductionism dominates medicine affects methods diagnosing  treating preventing diseases  natural inclination isolate individual factor responsible observed behavior  fact  birth medical specialties result reductionist strategy 
one must admit strategy extraordinarily successful  led discovery intimate nature cellular molecular structure human biology  also resulted spectacular advances clinical practice specialties  reductionism  however  limit  able explain phenomena  especially involve one origin require coordinated function different structures  systems   becoming evident biological functions rarely attributed individual molecules  contrarily  biological systems  health well disease  arise complex interactions among numerous components cells  protein  dna  rna small molecules  biological research last years revealed nature profound complexity biological systems  biggest challenge biology century take complexity  evident complexity cannot understood studying isolated genes proteins individually  fact  biological systems studied integrated whole 
an alternative reductionist mindset perspective based system  interpreted group individual elements possess emerging properties cannot attributed single element own  example system airplane  emerging property characterizes airplane capability fly  capability depend single one elements separately  wings  motors  pilots  etc    instead  depends integrated function whole  another words  new approach recognizes one cannot understand forests simply studying trees individually 
systems biology new interdisciplinary field research interactions elements  internal external  influence biological processes formulated mathematical expressions  systems biology conceived manage complexity observed biological systems quantitative modeled manner  holistic global approach allows us comprehend functions biological systems  processes  thoroughly research interactions  internally well systems  result appearance new emerging properties  practically biological process object study based systems biology strategy  instance  growth cell  interaction two bacteria blood circulation organism  develop strategy  necessary incorporate knowledge provided systems engineering  born norbert wieners cybernetics ludwig von bertalanffys general system theory   developing fields chaos theory  nonlinear dynamics complex systems science  together computational science  mathematics physics  also contributed analytical tools used systems analysis  following brief description main characteristics complex systems scale free networks 
complex systems scale free networks
a complex system set interconnected elements whose connections contain additional information hidden observer  interaction  new emerging properties arise that
cannot explained properties isolated elements  cell typical example complex system  composed many individual elements  ribosomes  mitochondria  nucleus  membrane  endoplasmic reticulum  proteins  dna  rna  etc    responsible specific function  elements respond non linear manner external perturbations  example  sometimes dna mutation effect survival cell  whereas times one single mutation fatal  addition  cell presents emerging properties cannot explained terms properties individual elements 
the behavior complex systems  cell internet  emerges orchestrated activity many components interact paired interactions  way  components system  or network  represented series nodes  or vertices  connected links  or segments   link representing interaction two components  together  nodes links form network or  formal mathematical terms  graph 
in nature  different types networks found  depending number type nodes links  social network  example  nodes people links could ties friendship amongst them  two people connected friends  examples networks include diseases  connected shared proteins genes   economy  banks connected shared investments   internet  electrical grids  many more  fact  rare able find network supporting activities  biological not 
traditionally  study properties networks  graph theory used  theory allows us  a  recognize links identify hubs  meaning nodes many links   b  illustrate structure overall network possible subgroups  c  thoroughly examine nature relationships elements network  d  clarify rules govern them  e  establish new global frameworks 
perhaps important property characterizes structure complex network p k  function link distribution  gives information probability randomly chosen node k connections  two fundamental types p k  distribution described  poisson  normal  scale free  fig     former important mainly due historical reasons  said networks first mathematically analyzed  analysis carried hungarian mathematicians paul erds     alfrd rnyi       poisson networks  nodes less number connections  meaning connections poisson network homogeneously distributed amongst nodes  contrary  important characteristic scale free networks high heterogeneity  nodes connections  moderately connected nodes extremely connected nodes  fig     highly connected nodes called nuclei  network centers hubs  apart characteristics  truly surprising ubiquity scale free networks  appear quite diverse settings  ranging small metabolic networks within cell large computer networks like internet  including banking networks  distribution gas electricity even terrorist networks 
another fundamental characteristic complex systems robustness  term refers capacity system respond changes external conditions internal organization without affecting normal behavior  sense  important point scale free networks amazingly resistant accidental failures  random error mainly affects small sized nodes  whose absence disturb integrity network  however  dependence hubs causes effect known vulnerability attack  implies elimination key hubs exscind system isolated clusters small poisson

the analysis complex networks recently applied satisfactorily human health disease diverse settings characterization   control   identification mechanisms influence metastatic propensity lethality cancer  example applicable respiratory medicine study allergic response experimental asthma model lu et al   based fact asthma polygenic disease many genes interacting  authors created network molecular interactions using database biomolecular object network databank superimposed changes observed gene expression changed experimental intervention  exposure ovalbumin   topologic analysis genes expressed experimental conditions determined inverse relationship change expression connectivity gene  words  genes high changes expression levels frequently situated periphery network  nodes low connectivity   hubs  nodes high connectivity  superhubs  nodes link hubs  tended less reactive experimental intervention  observations methodological biological implications  first all  suggest genes with
important biological functions could detected without using type research strategy  secondly  indicate least biological responses  allergic immune response  mediated changes nodes low connectivity 
the methodology derived scale free networks complex systems formerly described also used evaluate role environmental social factors diseases  example  christakis fowler  article published new england journal medicine  studied effects social networks prevalence obesity  so  constructed network participants framingham study  establishing connections among friends  neighbors  spouses family members  observed risk developing obesity increased   individual obese sibling  increased   individual obese friend  suggesting social network stronger factor risk obesity individual genetic load  cohort  authors also studied dynamics smoking cessation  year period  from    observed entire groups connected people stopped smoking time smokers progressively appeared periphery network

along advancement high throughput molecular biological methods  use terms personalized  individualized  precision  predictive medicine healthcare increased dramatically  much overlap exists terms  term precision medicine tends popular today  according us national library medicine  nih   precision medicine emerging approach disease treatment prevention takes account individual variability genes  environment  lifestyle person  national research council  nrc  defines personalized medicine older term meaning similar precision medicine  nrc suggests using newer term precision medicine avoid possible misinterpretations term personalized medicine treatment developed exclusively individual patient  beyond current technological abilities  national research council  us  committee framework developing new taxonomy disease    
from another point view  merging personalized medicine preventative medicine concepts one term  precision medicine may confusing scientific social points view  personalized medicine focused providing cure patient  precision medicine initiative de facto public health reduction severity treatment costs disease  paradigms different terms choice drugs  degree patient suffering  clarity outcome  current vision precision medicine appears focus disease classification using traditional phenotypic genetic approaches relevant disease prevention diagnosis rather treatment  precision medicine approach useful improving current state disease diagnostics identifying patient subgroups similar genetic  phenotypic  lifestyle parameters contribute disease 
a truly individualized  personalized medicine approach still required broad group patients cannot categorized mainstream precision medicine suffer diseases effective treatment options  oncology first area examples truly individualized clinical approach diagnosis therapy  kotelnikova et al      modern drugs developed precise molecular targets thus assumed used clearly identified molecular mechanisms given disease  therefore  disease mechanism affected signaling pathways individual patient must diagnosed first selecting therapy  context  calling approach either personalized precision medicine makes difference 
it necessary obtain patient dna and or rna samples start modern precision medicine roadmap  collected material analyzed different ways  classic methods cytogenetic analyses used detection large structural alterations genome  screening small mutations less important even single nucleotide variants polymorphisms  snps snvs  lead severe disruptions function proteins cells  technology perspective  previously popular methods biochip arrays increasingly replaced sequencing  nucleotide sequencing nonspecific reading order nucleotides sample require fragments molecules known structure detecting identical molecular patterns experimental sample 
the first thing learned analysis patients sample presence absence already known genetic variantsdisease biomarkersin genome  information population specific single genetic variants  snvs  found publicly available databases  several databases widely accepted contain quality information including  limited to  online mendelian inheritance man  omim  clinvar  sequence variation related human health  gwas catalog  nhgri ebi catalog  however  statistically significant association genetic markers disease depends population studied methods used study  hard definitely answer question causative variants statistically associated disease trait  even currently available data hundreds studies  lists genetic variants associated disease acquired different laboratories may even disjointed  human genome variation society example efforts made structure summarize results thousands studies conducted disease associations population distributions human genomic variations  hgvs  nevertheless  regard clinically significant genetic markers rather experimental ones  established standards today  number medically reliable markers low  although area applied science actively developed  commercial services launched  clinical guidelines published  he et al     kotelnikova et al     
pharmacogenomics serve example use known individual genetic markers suggest therapy  instance  several snvs thiopurine methyltransferase gene  trmt  known cause either high low transcriptional activity enzymes required catabolizing thiopurine drugs  azathioprine  aza   allele termed tpmt   widespread caucasians  downregulates thiopurine methyltransferase activity     time  tpmt   widespread variant east asia  causes   decrease enzyme activity  low tpmt activity significantly increases risk aza related adverse effects including leukopenia  myelosuppression  bleeding  screening level tpmt activity recommended initiating therapy aza 
polymorphisms impact absorption  distribution  clearance  kinetics drugs  ones trmt gene  called adme gene variants  for absorption  distribution  metabolism  excretion   polymorphisms cytochrome enzymes regard maintaining effective therapeutic doses warfarin tamoxifen another well known example adme gene variants  however  aside illustrative examples  number known adme biomarkers barely exceeds  tremaine et al     
most research attributed personalized medicine focuses mutation analysis diagnostics  however  analysis individual expression profiles also used diagnostics selection treatment  example  successful struggle oncologist lucas wartman diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia  wartman    based ability identify gene overexpressed leukemic cells  knowledge determined choice drug that  despite fact usually administered treat types cancer  turned effective  must say though cases inspirational rare  complex changes occur due interactions genes proteins difficult identify  also hard determine precise cellular mechanism affected drug target mechanism influenced alter course disease  dr  wartman states incredibly fortunate selected drug effective  wartman    
pathway analysis aimed assessment molecular systems rather individual genes typically assessed high throughput screening tests  approach promising since disease may originate different combinations multiple mutations functionally related groups genes changes activity interacting proteins  gene candidate method effective case diseases genetic heterogeneity  example  oncological diseases  flat list genes mutations altered expression much value diagnostics selection therapy without taking molecular interactions account  pathway analysis help connect affected molecular blocks one system thus allow scientist clinicians predict cellular functions altered 
pathway analysis ngs microarray expression results help find new applications known drugs discovering nontypical disease signaling pathways activated given patient  pathway analysis may also contribute development personalized drug therapy estimating benefits drug combinations  obviously  networks pathway models depict physical interactions compounds target proteins especially useful selection drugs minimum unexpected side effects new drug development general

beyond approach   useful highly descriptive  may give additional clarification terms destination big data called  prediction  personalization  prevention  participation prognosis   emphasizes  original way  role played large data volumes certain applications particularly relevant medicine  characteristics encourage us ask whole series questions added value term big big data  draw maximum benefit buying large volume information might extract it  might handle data help health professionals researchers  questions arise 
the application big data makes possible ability personalize detailed level interface offering solution  question thorough knowledge medical environment makes possible configure entire health care system  group specifically  health care service users  indeed individual patient  accumulation data makes possible identify risk patients  select best therapeutic diagnostic strategy aim optimizing early diagnosis  thus covering predictive prognostic side medicine   form medicine also aim avoiding medical complications  particularly heart vascular diseases  affect quality life patient prognosis  this preventive aspect curative aspect medicine  
in circumstances  field possibilities considerable and  nowadays  foresee significant transformations advent digital within health sphere produce  convergence technological innovation scientific research  digital  mathematics medical progress  direct repercussions upon medical practice based predominantly around medical procedures 
in addition  image people spending time information websites frequent use health applications smartphones  progressively common health service users increasingly wishing become responsible health  the participative aspect medicine  
the emergence connected predictive medicine cannot survive without  the standardization exchange formats medical devices  the development sector businesses start ups linked connected objects big data health sphere alteration medical protocols support prevention within health sector  working trained medical professionals alive nicts within health care sector  and the growth health data terms use regulation 
consequently  personalized medicine brings play numerous clinicians researchers  particularly chemistry molecular biology  particularly based analysis enormous quantity data  example biological genomic   medical imaging  texts unstructured data  features medical reports  questionnaires  hospital registers  non genetic markers biomarkers  bone density body mass index  even data linked environment  reporting symptoms tweets social networks 
to this  may add small data quantified self supply physiological environmental information mobile patient probes  integration biological data  individual  gives hope health researchers professionals  wish improve treatment patient  also boost disease prevention  consolidation data  indeed  make possible better monitoring improve knowledge impact different factors optimize patient care prevention long term monitoring  era disease management 
this trend around personalized medicine evolved jointly appearance new analytical technologies  new generation fast low cost dna sequencing  nicts also made interpretation large quantities data possible  on  idea expert systems processing record time approximately   billion pieces data dna sequencing emanating tumor  introduces concept given patient  entire team experienced doctors  unequal task 
we may take case danish bioinformatics specialists produced stratification patients based upon medical history  cardiac diseases diabetes  means patient monitoring several decades  so  use processing algorithms based causality around correlations were  hitherto  observed  objective understand simply how  ibm estimates continuous analysis individuals personal health data reduces chances death given condition   
moreover  big data improves danger risk recognition and  possible  prevents it  thus  beyond concept forward looking  objectiveis define risk represents potential danger  apply real time clinical scheme modified behavior  cite example american actress angelina jolie successively may underwent double mastectomy  march ovary fallopian tube removal  learned  genome sequencing  carrying mutation gene   leading risk greater   developing cancer following ten years  texas  business seton healthcare family put place predictive analytical algorithm limit risks patient re hospitalization  private hospital group indicated decreased risks  costs even mortality rates supply exact figures  his

such applications becoming integrated new style medical practice business model centered preventive procedures  reduction health expenses  favor outpatient treatment reducing long stay hospital care 
however  big data used view reducing costs represent important lever continuous improvement health care  collection mass utilization clinical parameters physiological data thus  potential profoundly transform health insurance markets 
this end   the then executive chairman google  eric schmidt  conference predicted  insurance industry is  apparently  brink seeing big data uses exploding  reality  nowadays  insurance industry simply process exploding  big data data interpretation  particularly genetic data  completely overturned traditional models health insurance  predictive medicine algorithms made possible insurers reduce risks becoming experts personalized health prevention  insurance professionals promoted programs encouraging individuals equip sensors subscribe personal genetics projects  thus saving thousands lives result trial preemptive strikes illnesses  cni    google invested health sphere through  example  recent updating medical encyclopedia comprising references diseases  investment fund  google ventures  nowadays manages two billion dollars worth assets notably taken wing start ups  which specializes genetic testing   foundation medicine  which specializes genetic cancer profiling  dnanexus  specializing exchange analysis genetic data

finally  american giants apple ibm joined forces launch collaboration  watson health cloud platform  intended host anonymous data gathered apple healthkit software apple researchkit module aim including users wish involved scientific research clinical trials  jac    moreover  apple led discussions two insurers  use information collected users application health  draw tailormade insurance contracts 
the company flatiron conceived big data solution called oncologycloud based upon idea   data potentially available around patients affected cancer yet analyzed  aim service take data collected diagnosis treatment  make available clinicians working cancer based studies 
in addition  according edition french daily newspaper le figaro  july   food drug administration  fda  started consultations search engine google recently  information current june   use data identify unknown secondary effects drugs  millions patients research internet concerning symptoms appropriate treatments  moreover  among health assistance users many make requests problems diseases treated  investigations interest american agency inform unidentified secondary effects time clinical trials  latter carried thousand patients treatments placed market thus find every problem  fda also interested projects microsoft  runs search engine bing    researcher eric horvitz scientists revealed using anti cholesterol medication pravachol anti depressant paroxetine  could often lead problem hyperglycemia  study led six million requests internet users one year period  showed internet users  made requests anti cholesterol tablet anti depressant  twice much research upon hyperglycemia searched one treatments 
furthermore  two companies apple ibm collaborated recently around major health data platform make possible apple iphone users monitor data sharing watson application  objective discover new medical perspectives potential user real time activity biometric data  however  issue big data simply end concept individual health  terms public health  exploitation massive volumes data contributes development new health products  detection missed signals epidemic serious undesirable effects health related aspects 
this metadata makes analysis exploitation behavior thousands individuals possible overlapping complex correlations  anticipating certain phenomena as  example  flu  indeed analysis volume data makes possible put place predictive algorithms  large scale processing big data permits  example  anticipation flu epidemic  google flu trends achieved combining research terms search engine google relating current health predictions  according  vik    googles software found combination research terms which  used together within mathematical model  form strong correlation predictions official figures  thus   google helped american health authorities  result model made possible predict development epidemic flu strain precisely

moreover  permanent geo localization connected applications supports  telephones  tablets computers  may favor precise understanding internet users invite users download health applications smartphones encouraging people undertake sport activity  briefs upon food calorific values often underestimated little known 
twitter also decided capitalize role public utility making possible plot spread influenza virus january   million tweets per day  twitter numerous data threads undertake extract studies 
big data also contribute fight spread epidemics  africa  mobile telephone geo localization data shown highly invaluable means track population movements actual population shifts  thus anticipate disease development national level  made possible predict spread ebola virus  strategies also tried follow haiti earthquake used help plan intended victim disaster relief shipments 
consequently  massive data implying large cohort patients  also potential accelerate scientific research experimental protocols many diseases treatments  example  researchers particularly used social network site facebook establish map americans greatest leaning towards obesity  wide ranging research would take considerable time would cost fortune classic investigative survey scale millions individuals 
in addition  start up flation health aims collect data upon cancer treatment provide essential knowledge cancer centers  practitioners  researchers sick necessary take right medical decisions  data gathered correspond population statistics  refunds treatments provided gathered health centers  doctors practices  hospitals insurance companies cloud computing system  data made available hospital independent practitioners  researchers  care centers assist treatment decisions  health professionals may thus access relevant data high quality statistics take better informed decisions upon appropriate treatments  may observed overlapping dna sequencing data  declared diseases living environment  profession type  dwelling factors  specifically allow improved understanding epigenetic   analysis data achieve full potential long cross referenced sources  example stemming treatments  diseases possibly even genetic information 
moreover  clustering ability make homogenous groups following given criteria may become one important commitments big data within health sphere within years come  cite case start up cardiologs  which recently chosen global innovation competition  developed automatic diagnostic tool interpret ecgs  electro cardiograms  using principles big data  originality approach stems technology used  algorithms used learn highly voluminous ecg datasets whose analysis interpretation carried beforehand digitized cardiology teams  represent classification algorithms cardiac diseases  based upon analysis entire signal ecgs associated diagnoses  tool build groups  or clusters   consist normal ecg patients  presenting given disease  aspects  thereafter  whenever presented new ecg reading  cardiologs tool able say category belongs whether belong category  finally  algorithm capable revealing interpretation according category  say  setting diagnosis  even formulating hypotheses patients condition remedied examination  for example ultrasound scan  blood test another test  
this solution  offering cardiovascular diagnostic assistance  functions real time technology uniting medical knowledge machine learning  purpose service thus consists optimizing patient care cardiovascular disorders 
consequently  majority big data rests upon big data uses concept forecasting  should  data  exploited anticipate conditions better  might data knowledge sufficiently accumulated able predict needs  problems behaviors  issues 
thus  personalized medicine define appropriate patient treatment also makes possible detect risks offer preventive solution  generally  big data favors understanding health problems  diseases  treatment efficiency organizations  massive data favors detailed studies health system optimize  even overturn preventive medicine predictive participative medicine particularly increasingly detailed prognoses  contribute creation standards intended public health research based data  saf   ste

  cognitive sphere patients ideas his her condition folk models health illness 
  emotional sphere patients feeling  emotions  affective reactions illness care 
  expectation sphere patients objectives desires processes outcomes care 
today  patient centered medicine worldwide recognized fundamental com  ponent healthcare system better correct  desirable  ethical approach healthcare  however  still uncertainty around actual meaning patient centeredness health practitioners  patients  health organizations  bardes   hanyok et al    miller et al     according liberati colleagues  liberati et al     review patient centered interventions high  lights least two main approaches  namely  dyadic organizational ones 
the dyadic approach patient centered medicine includes interventions focused strengthening empowering patient doctor communication words interventions focus individual experience illness  ther  apy administration  treatment management  example  basing narrative medicine approach  fioretti et al     dyadic studies usually centered clinical encounters individual interactions communications  explore inno  vative ways creating positive alliance patient health pro  vider  report outcomes showing interventions influence  or not  therapy effectiveness well being outcomes 
on hand  organizational interventions move focus inquiry clinical encounters overall healthcare context  words  intervene level procedures  practices  policies  organizational boundaries  roles communication medical offer order improve patient centered  ness level organizations services 
both approaches specular strengths limitations  dyadic patient  centered approaches may fail recognize organizational factors influence patients well being and or effectiveness illness management independently quality communication health provider  e g   complex time schedules care facility   also consider additional important figures  e g   caregivers   hand  organizational patient centered approaches address practitioners carry care local context capture patients perceive actually significant along care path 
on basis  appears evident mature approach patient centered medi  cine encompass dyadic organizational aspects  probably  could done adopting different stance  focused specific type interven  tion rather general features healthcare interventions order to approach healthcare health technology promote patient centeredness  approach medicine exactly guide contributions featured book  medicine
the approach medicine taken main guideline theory practice present book lies roots evolution medicine scientific activity  professor leeroy hood  pioneer systems biology  theorized modern medi  cine evolving medicine  hood galas   hood      biological point view  medicine traditional approach focused individual analysis one cell one protein  availability technology conveyed data around diseases patients allows researchers health providers adopt systems  holistic approach diagnosis treatment  hood thought future medicine would become predictive  per  sonalized  preventive  participatory  already hoods writings  also sub  sequent studies topic  concepts transcended systems biology embrace multiple disciplines approaches involved promoting healthcare  cesario et al    pulciani et al

as explained above  ps leeroy hoods model emerged concep  tion rooted systems biology extended social ethical aspects  so  original model could ignore another aspect much deserves included among main pillars well 
on basis  recently pravettoni gorini  gorini pravettoni   pravettoni gorini   proposed add fifth p model  namely  psychocognitive one  psychocognitive medicine  cfr  chap    emphasizes patient  considered person recipient care  characterized emotions  attitudes  cognitive processes specific relations his her care process  embracing fifth p  approach conception value healthcare goes beyond evidence based medicine approach  marzorati pravettoni   riva pravettoni    evidence based medicine regarded results clinical trials identify desirable medical procedures interventions  considers impact quality life additional fundamental marker effectiveness 
moreover  fifth p important methodological consequences healthcare  future medicine able design psychological cognitive profile patient  instead mere diagnostic classification  sense  medicine leads assessment psychometric tools include cognitive  decision making  mental aspects  well clinical ones 
specifically  sum up  fifth p proposes activities considered fundamental healthcare interventions  pravettoni gorini    development testing new psychometric instruments  devoted provide complete medical profile patient  promotion active patients decision making therapy healthcare process whole  right patient develop empathic relationship physician  assessment quality life inclusion among criteria necessary to
perform evaluation clinical procedures practices  value based medicine  
for sake completeness  could report also sixth p proposed literature  namely  public  bragazzi    analyzed famous case salvatore iaconesi  patient diagnosed cancer made medical records available internet social media  inviting everyone find cure his approach healthcare health technology disease  not medical also emotional spiritual terms   case interesting that  according bragazzi  shows healthcare evolving private dyadic  paternalistic relationship patient physician public issue extends therapeutic alliance multiple actors within social context 
anyway  highlights importance considering patient whole person  passive recipient medical care active individual looking meaning personal actualization  although aspects human experience  e g   happiness  self fulfillment  spirituality  probably considered objectives medicine  healthcare providers take account patients chronic disease combating physical illness also engaged personal journey whose final objective pursuit happiness fulfillment besides independently presence chronic health condition

  strengths ehealth
a number studies explored positive aspects ehealth  especially effective  ness improving physical  norman et al    van den berg et al    psychological  eland de kok et al    health outcomes 
another fundamental aspect related cost effectiveness or  better  ability ehealth interventions reduce overall costs managing disease treatment specific cases  although methodological problems exist always quote uncertainty evaluations  bergmo    data coming simula  tions suggest ehealth able sensibly reduce costs healthcare systems  cfr  chap     smit et al    stroetmann et al    
additionally  well known one main strengths ehealth  and telemedicine already  ability overcome distances periods time  drury   ray et al     example  communication technologies healthcare may useful reach patients living rural areas and or patients who  due symptoms conditions limited availability caregivers  experience significant diffi  culties move around places reach medical facilities locations important treatment adherence  e g   rehabilitation  pharmacy  etc   
for reason  ehealth telemedicine permit democratization patient doctor communication healthcare general  brandt et al    brown et al     health services could made accessible every  one  less independently availability patient economic resources 
ehealth demonstrated strong relation engagement  one hand user engagement  is  patients likely use technologies designed pleasant  involving  even funny  craig lefebvre et al    graffigna et al     example utilization gamifica  tion inclusion features typical games video games health related technological interfaces  mccallum   sardi et al     instance  patients invited report adherence behaviors game achievements positive feedback prizes received

finally  ehealth could provide opportunities structure participation healthcare multiple actors  patients physicians also caregivers  stakeholders  multiple types health providers  indeed  context social approach healthcare health technology media platforms  figure important patients health wellness could his  profile online presence  order actively positively participate care process 
  criticalities ehealth emerging challenges
when considering ehealth  important recognize also shortcomings appearing number technology implementation healthcare possible risks limitations 
one recent review  granja et al    explored factors determining success failure ehealth interventions  results focused category costs  specifi  cally authors highlighted that  organizational point view  ehealth could enhance workload healthcare professionals cause workflow disrup  tion  well complexify role definition undermine face to face communication 
as abovementioned  ehealth expected reduce costs  additional costs may develop regarding technology design  maintenance  possible redesign negative results emerging evaluation  chaudhry et al     consistently  implementation ehealth may require health providers include additional  specific competences make work long run  e g   technical assistance  
moreover  although generally ehealth potentialities terms user engage  ment  recognized patients users general may posi  tive attitude towards  currie et al    lgar et al     technology acceptance important issue field  people may prone actually use it  sometimes could even refuse to  behavior related various forms digital divide  voelker    example  patients  or think not  basic knowledge competences technology usage  also happen users initial positive attitude towards technology  cease use given period time  reason technology acceptance technology adoption considered two separate issues  last one per  taining long term usage adherence system  triberti et al     reason  design ehealth  especially interfaces  i e   part technology direct contact user   conducted giving high importance usability user experience  point gold standard ehealth design found many authors user centered design  ucd  techniques cf  chapter  holzinger et al    triberti barello   vorderstrasse et al     ucd refers design process final users important influ  ence design takes place  garrett   lowdermilk    usually  means employing qualitative research methods analyze users behavior  needs  context inform design guide evaluation  done traditional usable approach  ucd may costly first phase an g  pravettoni s  triberti
intervention  also designers engineers inclined base work research data  however  correctly applied  approach could effec  tively eliminate usage issues typically intervene later stages interven  tion process 
other important criticalities consider ehealth related privacy  various kinds patients data adequately preserved protected  ethics  ehealth implementation become excuse physi  cians transfer clinical care software machines  automatization healthcare process could partly achieved  thanks ehealth technologies  could objective patient centered   informed approach patients illnesses  conclusion

  brief history
as previously mentioned  personalized medicine known field  since ancient times  doctors convinced onset diseases different causes  believed subjects disease treated differently one another physical psychic differences 
previously  egyptians distinguished endogenous causes  corruption intestinal contents due matter pecans   exogenous causes  natural calami  ties  parasites  bites animals   hidden causes  revenge dead person  wrath god  hatred enemies   finally psychogenic causes  mood disorders psychosomatic pathologies  
subsequently  hippocrates   b c   began take care ill person disease  grmek    considering alimentation  physical activity  life  style  climate  hippocrates unifies critical analysis patient  sick  ness  physician proposes integration physical psychological uniqueness subject socio cultural physical  geographical complexity environment  zitelli palmer    claudio galeno introduced concept predisposition   a c    taking humoral theory hippocrates  introduced two internal causes beside bodys external causes  introduction personalized ehealth causes predispose certain individual certain diseases immediate causes doctor see disease started
galeno also expanded theory healing patient  argues healing illness also depends heavily patients life habits  alimenta  tion  rest  sexual activity  emotional state   according theory patient needs individualized attention  since preservation health changes according complexions bodily habitus  sotres

   ctcs ctdna analysis
ctcs ctdna cancer biomarkers complementary roles  outlining dif  ferent information  less useful regard specific research needs clinical contexts  ctcs isolated several methods  using physi  cal  immunologic  molecular  functional assays     several platforms ctcs detection commercially available  cellsearch system fda  approved clinical use  antibody based assay  ctcs isolated double check positive negative selection  cell identified ctc cellsearch epcam  epithelial cell adhesion molecule  positive  cytokeratins positive   negative 
for many years  ctcs count used alone prognostic tumor bio  marker  recent advantages isolation sequencing technologies changed perspective  paving way dna  rna  protein analysis single cell level  heitzer et al    lohr et al    perakis speicher    however  limitations exist  ctcs detection remains challenging  especially low concentration blood  detection enrichment steps require sensitive specific analytic methods  made possible expensive tech  nologies  pantel alix panabires   lowes et al

like ctcs  ctdna analysis disadvantages  even technically easier cheaper ctcs count  pre analytical analytical procedure validation still lacking  potential confounding factor presence normal cell free dna must separated cell free tumoral dna  besides technical consid  erations  relevant conceptual question biological meaning ctdna must pointed out  little known origin ctdna  ctcs  lytic  apoptotic tumor cells    assuming released dying tumor cells  provide information therapy resistant clones 
in conclusion  liquid biopsy demonstrated valid surrogate tissue sampling  nevertheless  scrupulous demonstration analytic validity  clinical validity  clinical utility essential introduction clinical practice  ngs implementation clinical practice  challenges limitations
the goal improvement cancer knowledge ultimately improvement patients care  scientific value ngs based advancements undoubt  edly critical  clinical benefits deriving still discussed 
as previously mentioned  ngs allows us obtain entire sequence can  cers exome even genome reasonable price  medical genetics  example  wes wgs represent important tool diagnose genetic inherited disor  ders  information might role determining best diagnos  tic therapeutic approach cancer patients  smaller targeted panels often used clinical practice  jennings et al    
when designing ngs cancer panel  critical distinguish driver alterations incidental  irrelevant genetic variants  complex process  called variants prioritization  essentially made possible large publicly accessible data  bases like cosmic  catalogue somatic mutations cancer   ucsc cancer genomics browser  cbioportal  resources designed trans  lational bridge researchers clinicians  lower barriers access  made comprehensible complex data sets provided large scale genome projects like tcga cgp  field  development genie project certainly another step forward  multiphase  multiyear  international project converges regularly updated registry containing existing clia   iso certified genomic data obtained course routine practice multiple international institutions  information provided certainly useful variants prioritization  also available powering clinical translational research  vali  dating biomarkers  expanding drug labels identifying new drug targets  s  morganti et al 
thanks efforts  many ngs based cancer panels currently available clinical practice  one example  gene oncomine focus assay  includes genes targeted on market oncology drugs published evidence  company offers wider panel   genes   even larger panels recently validated  including fda approved foundationone cdx     detects mutations genes genomic signatures tumor type  also fda approved msk impact   gene assay developed memorial sloan kettering cancer center  mskcc  
the best panel size clinical practice fueled intense debate  since many identifiable driver alterations still approved drug available  performing large panels every cancer patient yet affordable  however  improvement cancer knowledge provided wide mutational panels per  formed large scale might encourage effort  particularly helpful sense may recently published esmo scale clinical actionability molecular targets  escat   mateo et al     proposes classification system molecular aberrations  dividing six levels actionability clinical usefulness  based strength evidence clinical studies  scale might help prioritize alterations  order design pragmatic affordable panels everyday oncology practice  besides size panel  discussion still open regarding clinical benefit deriving molecular characterizations  large prospective studies conducted still ongo  ing address question  shiva trial  le tourneau et al     instance  studied off label use targeted therapies patients cancer type har  boring matching molecular alterations  study failed show benefit standard treatments  arguing indiscriminate use off label molecules according uncharacterized molecular alterations whose significance driver mutations unknown  failure must interpreted considering aim study itself  powered evaluate specific drug would antitu  mor activity selected subgroup patients able evaluate efficiency treatment algorithm used allocate drugs basis molecu  lar profiling  failure precision medicine  demonstration inef  ficacy treatment algorithm improving patients outcome

beside great potential  implementation precision medicine real  world cancer care several limitations  first all  costs ngs based tests still prohibitive largely reimbursed  representing patients effort out of pocket expense  costs targeted gene panels vary widely  mainly depend  ing numbers genes sequenced  example  recently published nation  wide french study reported cost ranging  marino et al     whereas cost effective analysis conducted studies tan et al  calculated average cost   usd per sample  range     usd   tan et al     authors observed cost sequencing generally lower performed in house compared outsourcing service provider 
many concerns raised impact costs terms clinical benefit  even evidences cost effectiveness still lacking many cancer types  nsclc upfront mutational analysis based ngs demonstrated less costly faster single gene test approach  presented asco   economic model showed saving billion dollars us medicare reimbursement  pennell et al

implementation  actually mean tailor technology users  least four possible answers readers could considered reading book considering approach ehealth 
  technology developers keep mind fundamental characteristics diagnosis consequences everyday life  both physical psy  chological   order design tools could used effectively causing harm 
  ehealth tools future include personalization features pleasant engaging aspects users could develop positive attitude toward use possibly driven toward higher rate acceptance adoption long term  cf  chap    
  ehealth tools future developed features allowing mod  ifications later stages interventions  according users feedback 
  technology developers keep up to date scientific litera  ture development effectiveness ehealth solutions  order address issues known within literature  especially regards factors may promote hinder acceptance adoption among users 
all possible answers feature directions important certainly deserve ehealth developers stakeholders consideration  however  none could considered sufficient point view expressed ehealth approach indications technology design 
specifically  first response merit considers medical charac  teristics chronic diseases fact could important influences everyday life  physical psychological  however  pathol  ogy influences effective humantechnology interaction  neither acceptance adoption long term  patients patients  despite ehealth tool  technology could designed order used patients whose lifestyle influenced onset continuous presence chronic disease  also personal preferences  habits behaviors could get way effective usage  technology could inadequate contextual factors nothing users health status  moreover  organizational level  possible expect technology designers would develop health professionals specific knowledge competences  neither health professionals would fully employed design development technology 
the second response values psychological aspects interaction more  fails giving specific guidelines include design development process  moreover  seems consider psychological aspects preferences positive emotions transient could change course time  pos  sibly making ehealth solutions adequate users long term 
the third response takes steps acknowledging iterative nature evolved conception technology design often features  certainly  ehealth design take consideration modifications could necessary every step implementation interaction  design process end final prototype  however  response provide specifications kind information one consider modifying redesigning user centered design approaches methods ehealth technology  users feedback sufficient  next pages show response last question could simple 
finally  fourth answer points one important aspect  is  ehealth development based scientific information  designers skills creativity  however  important appreciate even scientific literature sufficient inform design  indeed  scientific results necessarily based samples tend oversee individual characteristics differences  course  ehealth development needs based general guidelines but  order effective augment possibilities adopted  able consider specific cases fine grained practice information often could included scientific reports 
in conclusion  tailoring technologies users guiding concept possi  bly includes considerations outlined above  go beyond including specific guidelines practice  therefore  chapter aimed outlin  ing methodological consideration translate concept practice  give specific information tailoring could enacted ehealth project  first steps design final implementation  specifically  proposal chapter relies methods so called user centered design  ergonomics user centered design
in opinion  best way introduce concept user centered design locate history technology evaluation  indeed  technologies  especially designed used healthcare context  always need evaluated  means  demonstrated whether able  help human users to  achieve aims  not 
historically  so called scientific study work emerged industrial revolution  considered first organized way evaluate technolo  gies  nickerson   triberti brivio    aims analyze human work  often mediated industrial technologies  order divide simple actions could taught workers order improve productivity 
subsequently  ergonomics  mostly europe  human factors  mostly united states  emerged   disciplines devoted improve physical ana  tomical cognitive aspects technology mediated work order improve product quality productivity also safety possibly subjective satisfaction  karwowski   sharit   wilson   
in   usability arose simplified form ergonomics focused industrial design  namely  discipline interested empowering interface common use objects  products services make easy use immedi  ately comprehensible customers  stakeholders  users  triberti brivio    usability experts jakob nielsen donald norman set basis evaluation things tools us use every day  generated idea easiness use important artifacts properties originality aesthetic beauty  nielsen     norman    s  triberti e  brivio
however  recent development disciplines methods associated tools technologies highlighted easiness of use sole criterion taken consideration evaluating technology  user experience  ux  umbrella term used nowadays identify methodological approaches recognize role additional factors emotion affection pleasure  e g   people use nonusable objects love them  context  e g   besides usability interfaces  tools less adequate physical  social  cultural features situations use   benyon et al    hassenzahl   lee et al    triberti brivio   
this development led global recognition evaluation technology take account functioning only  multiplicity criteria quantify effectiveness  least quality  safety  easiness of use  emotions  positive  necessarily negative  possible manage users   adequacy con  text  physical  social  cultural   accessibility  e g   technology could used vari  ous populations  people disability included  
obviously  evaluating characteristics technology  taking account partial total redesign could called one criteria appear insufficient  could costly terms time resources  herstatt von hippel   pavelin et al     however  designers  developers  stakeholders could consider important criteria technology effectiveness advance  means  design could based user research data  preexistent ideas  about users  contexts  related activities  issue addressed technology  creativity intelligence designers  exactly concept core user centered design  ucd henceforth   garrett   lowdermilk   triberti brivio   triberti liberati    broad term encompasses design project users users research influence design takes place  according garrett     ucd could depicted strategy  in perfect scenario  allows possible issue variable escape designers awareness  words  implementing ucd means users involved steps design order provide valuable information design itself  last steps implementation evaluate already developed prototype  abras et al     although term ucd relatively old  norman draper used first time already   norman draper    developed discipline recent times  consistently semi standardization methods tools devoted analyze users needs design 
the next section would devoted introduce typical ucd tools tech  niques could adapted serve ehealth design development  taking account importance aspects highlighted answers  i e   attention literature  consideration disease illness related issues  user engage  ment  iterative prototyping   application techniques could help ehealth developers tailor technologies users  order assure positive functioning  also implementation described book  user centered design approaches methods ehealth   interaction factors
as hesse shneiderman say  hesse shneiderman    pioneer  ing days ehealth  question often computer could do  ehealth pioneers posed technical questions computers  internet  soft  wares capability help patients keep trace medications therapy disease  next phase  crucial questions concern people  and  would add  cannot  
this concept true many senses  section focus interaction aspects only  previously said  history technology evaluation featured usability discipline interested developing interfaces easy under  stand use final users  certainly  usability important charac  teristic currently taken consideration evaluating adequacy effectiveness ehealth solutions  number studies published focus  ing methods results medical informatics usability  gerdes et al    goldberg et al    vorderstrasse et al     however  many studies employ usability questionnaires final users technology already designed  as prototype  even final version  often clear whether data influence actual modification redesign evaluated platforms 
usability questionnaires  such as  e g   sus  brooke    certainly use  ful tools get  author says  quick dirty index easiness of  use system application  nevertheless  conceived give full usability evaluation  let us say  example  one obtains average to high value usability basing participants filling given questionnaire  mean  general evaluation participants performed responding general questions  information provided specific  less serious  less frequent system usage issues  indeed  typical questions usability questionnaires are  able use system without effort  state scale much felt able obtain system goal using system  obviously  responses questions refer general evaluation account specific issues could prevent users achieve objectives real life contexts 
for reason  correct way examine usability implement specific research methods  typically divided two categories  namely  usability inspection testing methods 
usability inspection refers methods performed evaluators  without involvement final users  constituted guidelines rules ana  lyze interfaces systematically  order account usability problems may escape general  nonspecialized exploration  currently  main usability inspec  tion methods still used cognitive walkthrough  which based exploring function interface sequence  reporting possible problems encoun  tered hypothetical user  heuristics analysis  which global  holistic analysis interface  
cognitive walkthrough  kushniruk et al    entails checklist followed evaluators put shoes users  accounting possible s  triberti e  brivio
action user would take interface signaling possible mistake interaction issue  differently  heuristic evaluation based list general crite  ria interfaces respect order guarantee effective usage  number heuris  tics lists available  generic  and probably used  nielsen    others specific technologies domains  hermawati lawson   
another option  that could also used conjunction inspection methods  usability testing  constitutes technique evaluation involves final users interact interface systematic less controlled con  texts  order identify usability issues critical evaluation actual interaction  usability testing could employ number methods tools registering usabil  ity issues  ranging physiological signals interviewing participants observation behavior  e g   counting number errors   smilowitz et al    
with regard evaluation interaction factors  main suggestion coming approach resolve issues basic evaluations using usability questionnaire alone  contrary  evaluators activated phase development process  specifically  usability inspection test  ing methods applied different phases conceptualization interface prototyping  order modify interaction issue itinere 
  motivation emotion
user experience limited usability  explained sections above  user experience  as discipline  emerged role additional factors explic  itly recognized  indeed  enough interface easy use  especially expected promote long term usage  one would plan use tech  nologies change patients everyday life  order positively influence lifestyle care process  ehealth resources also engaging  pleasant  even self actualizing 
according positive technology paradigm  riva et al     technologies used structure  augment  replace users experience digital resources  order improve well being terms emotion  connections  meaning  generally  order advance technologies ability sense  important consider motivational emotional factors  indeed  frequent users use  even long term  technologies easy use love  contrary  following sections explore motivation emotional factors important aspects considered evaluating designing technology 
   motivation design
motivation generally refers mental feature guides promotes human goal directed behavior  assessing motivation use technology requires going beyond traditional conceptions motivation held people give value user centered design approaches methods ehealth to strictly physical safety needs  satisfying consider relational self actualizing motives  e g   friends  succeed ones passions  spirituality  etc    contrary  depending current situations personal goals  people may put high level needs basic ones  according self determination theory  ryan deci    fundamental life nutrients regard creating maintaining positive relationships others  feeling competent autonomous  hassenzahl colleagues  hassenzahl et al    developed motivation focused interviewees order consider users important motivation designing evaluating products artifacts  field user centered design ehealth interventions  one consider users needs may vary depending experience perception long lasting illness  life projects everyday activities  triberti barello    advisable design ehealth technologies considering therapy outcomes and or desired health states  contrary  technologies designed used effectively  able communicate scope useful terms patients per  sonal objectives  triberti riva   
   emotion design
emotional design expression typically used refer design implemented promote pleasurable sensation users  two main approaches found literature  one focused pleasant  funny  creative features added interfaces external appearance  jordan    related engaging fluent interaction  hancock et al     recent studies  triberti et al    proposed develop concept emotional design three main lines  assessment discrete emotions ongoing interaction technology provide on line modifications interfaces  affective computing affective design   focus emotions discrete cognitive processes instead generic pleasant states  promote even complex emotions emotional nuances  analysis users emotional profiles tailor technologies preex  isting emotional traits 
in words  emotions considered simply by products stimuli  rather could actively participate interaction influence it  also  positive emotions taken consideration designers  example  one design ehealth platform feature meant signal dangerous situations patient  e g   need insulin administration diabetes   expected transform urgent signal positive experi  ence  not  contrary  previous emotion focused research avail  able  designers evaluators important information realize alarm recognized  understood  managed effectively possible patient user  s  triberti e  brivio

notwithstanding emphasis placed advancement innovation ehealth sector  poised creation europe wide ecosystem data driven healthcare  smith    eu policymakers equally alerted privacy data protection concerns european citizens maintain confronted new technologies practices  mager    accordingly  following tri  logue  and extensively lobbied  negotiations started   european parliament approved regulation  eu    data protection  also known general data protection regulation  gdpr   remarked rapporteur  german mep jan albrecht  gdpr intended provide right balance fundamental right data protection well strong consumer rights digital age  one side  need create fair functioning digi  tal market  real chance growth innovation  side  albrecht

at core  enshrined data protection design default prin  ciple  art     gdpr adopts risk based approach data protection  geared ensure appropriate data protection measures designed implemented throughout entirety data processing activities  additionally  confers novel rights data subjects  right data portability  art    so called right forgotten  art     former bestows individuals right require data concerning standardized made portable across companies service providers choice  latter empowers data subjects obtain data controllers prompt erasure relevant personal data  moreover  gdpr prescribes adoption specific provisions processing sensi  tive data  art    scientific research purposes  art     technical organizational measures  e g   pseudonymization   meant provide ade  quate safeguards rights freedoms data subjects  provisions explore detail beloware poised great impact development commercialization novel ehealth tools technologies  relevantly  gdpr also endows member states prerogative maintain introduce conditions  including limitations  regard processing genetic data  biometric data data concerning health  art      
  accountability principle implications
in general terms  axiomatic cornerstone gdpr said repre  sented accountability principle  art      art     requires data con  trollers  i e   persons  companies  associations  entities factually control personal data processing  adopt proactive approach toward data protection compliance  notably  data controllers made responsible assess  implement  verify adoption appropriate technical organizational measures ensure  able demonstrate  data processing complies gdpr  art     gdpr provides coarse grained guidance measures actually fulfill controllers obligations  fact makes determina  tion measures dependent contingent nature  scope  context purposes relevant processing  art     accordingly  argued gdpr bound promote controller based  case sensitive  eminently contextspecific approach data protection  marelli testa   
such decentralized  flexible  accountability based approach rises signifi  cance respect two aspects key importance development adoption phase ehealth technologies  namely  consent secondary use data  further processing   regard consent  gdpr requires specific  and  informed consent data subject  art     a  recital    however  comes processing personal data within researchas case developmental phase ehealth technologies  mhealth apps  telemedical ambient intelligence toolsit recognizes may possible fully iden  tify potential future research purposes time data collection  accordingly  data protection ethical issues european ehealth as per recital   states that  specific consent would impinge pur  pose research  data subjects allowed give consent certain areas scientific research keeping recognized ethical standards scientific research  otherwise put  provision lends full legislative weight gdpr support broad consent  whenever criterion specific consent specific research use moment data collection proves impossible sat  isfy  marelli testa   
as use previously collected processed dataa key require  ment big data processingarticle    b  gdpr mandates personal data collected specified  explicit legitimate purposes processed manner incompatible purposes  additionally  specifies processing scientific research purposes shall       considered incompatible initial purposes personal data collected  specifically  gdpr requires controllers carry out  case by case context dependent basis  test compatibility assess  ment  geared ascertaining whether processing personal data without data subjects consent compatible initial purpose data originally collected  art       factors reasonable expectations data subjects based relationship controller use  recital    context personal data collected  among key elements taken account assessing compatibility intended processing  art      
  pseudonymization anonymization sensitive data
an important distinction introduced gdpr one pseudony  mized anonymous data  art     defines pseudonymization process  ing personal data manner personal data longer attributed specific data subject without use additional information  pro  vided additional information kept separately subject technical organizational measures ensure personal data attributed identified identifiable natural person  contrary  anonymous data defined  per recital   information relate identified identifiable natural person personal data rendered anonymous man  ner data subject longer identifiable  difference signifi  cant implications  one hand  pseudonymized datainsofar attributed data subject use additional informationare con  sidered personal data whose processing comply gdpr  hand  provisions gdpr concern processing anony  mous information  including statistical research purposes  recital    words  whereas processing pseudonymized information sub  jected full spectrum provisions contained gdpr  individuals entitled data protection rights data processed anonymously  v  sanchini l  marelli
but constitute anonymous processing  or  better phrased  processing anonymous data  light gdpr  interestingly  gdpr differs conspicuously  respect  major data protection legislations world  wide  health insurance portability accountability act  hipaa  privacy rule usa  shabani et al     within privacy rule  safe harbor standard achieving de identification personal data singles distinct identifiers  removal said make resulting information individually identifiable  thus anonymous  differently this  recital gdpr states personal data considered anonymous insofar data subject cannot identified means reasonably likely used       either controller person  gdpr recital   see also article working party  opinion     ascertain whether means rea  sonably likely used identify natural person  gdpr states account taken objective factors  costs amount time required identification  taking consideration available technol  ogy time processing technological developments  recital   
as such  line overall decentralized thrust regulation  gdpr said adopt context based criterion determine whether personal data considered irreversibly de identified  and thus anonymous   devolving controllers responsibility address question  is reasonable likelihood reidentification techniques effectively used de anonymize given dataset   context concrete processing activities 
moreover  definition anonymous data advanced gdpr seems create catch  situation  shabani marelli    one hand  seen  processing anonymous data subjected safeguards entailed gdpr  represents implicit incentive processing sharing anonymous information  hand  however  precisely absence said safeguards  well enhanced circulation data  factors that  themselves  bound increase likelihood reidentification data subject  which  turn  lead de anonymization dataset  thus  approach toward anonymous data processing adopted gdpr said set high legal bar achieving anonymization data  quinn quinn  especially context processing genetic data  shabani marelli   
  right balance innovation protection individuals rights interests 
as explicitly stated regulation  adoption gdpr under  pinned aim accomplish  once  two seemingly contrasting objectives  namely  protection fundamental rights freedoms individuals regard processing personal data  i e   data protection   enhancement data protection ethical issues european ehealth of free movement personal data within eu  view creation full fledged digital single market poised foster digital innovation  i e   data util  ity   data protectionversusdata utility conundrum  implementation controller based decentralized approach data protection  place rigid detailed provisions  assessed ambivalently 
on one hand  beside introduction novel rights data subjects  flexibility entailed mechanisms compatibility test  well enhanced role assigned institutionalized ethics defining scope data pro  cessing research   innovation programs  on aspect  cf  marelli testa    could said increase data subjects protection affording patients and or research participants substantive rather mere formalistic engagement development use novel ehealth technologies 
on hand  however  addition controllers discretionary preroga  tives  gdpr upholds far reaching research exemption strict limita  tions otherwise imposed processing sensitive data  art       instance relaxing requirements consent  recital   limitations data storage  art     e    addition  per recital   gdpr provides remarkably broad defi  nition activities falling rubric scientific research  including tech  nological development demonstration  applied research  privately funded research  consequence  ehealth mhealth companies  such app providers  telemedical companies  ai companies  etc    claiming conduct scien  tific research activities data gathered individuals  stand benefit directly regulatory leeway deriving combined provisionswith arguably significant shift balance interests favor data controllers data subjects  pormeister   marelli testa   
in final analysis  whether gdpr achieve stated aim ensuring right balance providing appropriate safeguards individualsthus allaying still widespread privacy data protection concerns surrounding ehealth technologies  powles hodson  and creating conditions thriving digital single market domains health care  something implementation coming months years able tell  ethical issues ehealth technologies
notwithstanding similar data protection concerns raised  expression ehealth  cf  eysenbach   connotes vast array different technologies  as well related social practices   raises distinct ethical issues  follows  ehealth technologies divided three broad families  online ehealth  self management tools  monitoring techniques new unconventional ehealth technologies
the respective ethical aspects discussed separately  v  sanchini l  marelli
  online ehealth  self management  tools
one widespread forms ehealth represented consumers demand online health information  remains one important subjects internet users research online  fox    besides dedicated websites  health  related information increasingly accessed blogs social media  according fox  information commonly searched within broad category referring diseases and or medical problems  medical treatment and or medical procedure  information regarding doctors health care professionals  fox    study also shown vast majority online ehealth consumers consists people affected chronic diseases  whose primary aim broadening information disposal also finding peers  is  people affected condition  share experiences could receive advice and or sup  port  giving rise distinct forms biosociality  a term coined renowned anthropologist paul rabinow    capture emergence new collectivities  social networks  social interactions forming around shared biologicalespe  cially geneticand medical characteristics   so called peer to peer health care  cf  chap    rapidly expanding  usa beyond  fox   
by helping acquiring information respect health health related issues  ehealth technologies said provide individualsindependently liter  acy and or economic statuswith opportunity become informed thus better prepared discuss treatment plans physicians  czaja et al    p    taha et al     particular  facilitating peer to peer interactions allowing patients get touch medical expert networks and or patient associations  online ehealth technologies contribute patients acquaintance health related issues  thus promoting improvement medical literacy 
what depicted emancipatory affordance online ehealth tools may  however  give rise number pitfalls  firstly  much informed online individual may become distrustful patient  unwilling adhere medical advices provided conventional face to face settings  czaja et al     secondly  individual may equally turn consumer online commercialized prod  ucts lacking clear medical preventive benefits without adequate medical over  sightsomething shown occur  instance  case unproven stem cell therapies well direct to consumer genetic tests  cf   e g   wallace   
another criticality ascribed online ehealth self management tools concerns way online ehealth information presented tools designed  sets people likely engage online searches people sharing health concerns include internet users caring loved one  internet users experi  enced medical crisis past year  internet users experienced significant change physical health  weight loss gain  pregnancy  quitting smoking  fox     data protection ethical issues european ehealth indeed  despite promise improving access health information  date many internet based health applications designed without consideration needs  capabilities  preferences user group s   czaja et al    p     although recalled group users looking health information online rather heterogeneousspanning adults older adults  affected chronic well nonchronic conditionsthese tools platforms often devised without considering potential difficulties users may encounter navigating information understanding content 
to summarize  two main sets criticalities may ascribed ehealth online technologies  formerdistrust toward medical experts  patients turned  consumers without adequate medical oversightrepresents potential negative impact aforementioned technologies online consumers  latterinade  quacy ehealth online tools respect target usersquestions appropri  ateness technologies comply expectations set forth deployment 
a fruitful strategy partially overcoming issues may found notion patient engagement  cf  chap     defined act involving patients well latters availability involvedin health care pro  cesses  gruman et al    hibbard mahoney   clancy   barello et al    menichetti et al     broad terms  engaging patients considered key priority contemporary health care policy objective many countries  thompson    besides fostering patients capacity signifi  cantly impact orientation  management  evaluation research programs concerning diseases  patient activation associated better adherence treatments improved treatment outcomes  greene hibbard   vahdat et al    
in context ehealth technologies investigation here  patient engagement may lead design technologies closely match users preferences  indeed  patients shown adopt new technologies tools felt relevant health care problems  engaging easy use  effective achieving behaviour change  birnbaum et al    p     such  without considering patient active agent health  care environment  ehealth solutions run risk substantially ineffective end  triberti barello   p     consequence  user centered design advanced gold standard developing ehealth tools future  cf  chap    
in addition  engaged role part patients onset technological development also reduce risk perceived harm related technology usage  e g   uncertainty privacy rights  management ones health data  would negatively influence users acceptance later time  indeed  despite initial enthusiasm ehealth technologies  evidence exists patients remain skeptical toward technological tools evolve v  sanchini l  marelli line changes  renewed attitudes  needs  currie et al    gaul and
ziefle   
  monitoring techniques
a second family ehealth technologies so called monitoring techniques  is  set techniques allowing continuous observation ones condi  tion  physiological physical  performed body and or home sensors  monitoring techniques originally developed improving health care locally  contexts geographical distances would precluded regular health measures  additionally  typically devised monitoring behavior chronic patients and or elderly  communicating relevant health and or behavioral information real time health care professionals and or reference family member  amongst broad set monitoring techniques  important difference exists conventional monitoring techniques  telemedicine  rather new unconventional monitoring techniques  labeled rubric ambient intelligence  two sets monitor  ing systems differ profoundly terms technological capacities impact patients health  also terms ethical threats potentially related  ab use

traditional ehealth monitoring systems telemedicine different instantiations present several sets advantages  among following also ethically relevant  firstly  cf  chap     may improve health outcomes allow patients assisted and or cured home environments  also reducing costs inconveniences patients due prolonged admissions hospital based commuting  additionally  may enable provision high  quality home services  prolonging much possible patients indepen  dencethus positively impacting patients quality life  thirdly  ehealth monitoring systems hold potential improving health care professionals daily activities  indeed  telemedicine able make available attending physician existing information related single patient send it  consulting purposes  specialists world  moreover  contributes reduce unnecessary administrative work  time enabling secure organized management information  finally  reducing prolonged and or unnecessary hospitalizations  ehealth monitoring systems also increase effi  ciency productivity health services  bauer   stanberry    monitoring technologies therefore enable progress management care chronic patient well elderlyleading identification potential health problems become serious  cf  chap    
however  despite providing high data quality may help ensure correct pro  cessing interpretation information  well appropriate intervention medical services  serious ethical concerns exist respect potential misuse patients information  particular  use technologies usually accom  panied concerns related informational privacy  is  regarding type information recorded  recorded  shared  appears particularly controversial case new unconventional aforemen  tioned monitoring systems  ambient intelligence

firstly  already mentioned  relevant ethical concern regards infor  mational privacy  case ambient intelligence  scholars noticed  almost kind data gathering may potentially represent privacy violation  example  use image processing video cameras potential kind sensor deemed controversial area  cook et al    p     cameras filming users specific conditions and or per  forming certain activities may appear violation individual personal sphere  line observation  interesting notice that  according empirical evidence collected  beach et al       requests greater con  fidentiality exist respect information acquired certain specific house areas  such bathroom bedroom  privacy violation intuitively perceived serious side target user  besides implementation gdprs accountability based approach described first part chapter  solutions exist order limit privacy concerns  limiting cam  eras registration specific environments space obscuring bodies  but  pointed out  even seemingly innocuous ones walking patterns eating habits combined provide detailed information persons identify lifestyle  bohn et al    
secondly  relatedly  so called big brother syndrome  dwight feigelson    is  negative feeling observed technology itself  may impact personal behavior  inasmuch individuals may modify behaviors precisely consequence knowing registered  thus limiting de facto personal liberties  ambient intelligence technologies  respect  may shape individual behaviors  leading self disciplining individual 
finally  concerns related actual validity users authorization toward techniques raised  indeed  despite rhetoric transparency respect ambient intelligence systems  several doubts exist respect validity target users consent  latter may based users misconcep  tions and or partial misrepresentation system functioning  based upon preliminary explanations may hardly convene adequate representa  tions system user embedded  addition enriching oral explanation ambient intelligence systems videos figurative representations  possible solution may envisaging multistep data protection ethical issues european ehealth consent provided different time points  before  also distinct set phases system

the term precision medicine become popular recent years  fuelled scientific well political perspectives     superseded term personalised medicine  defined synonymously     dismissed argument physicians always treated patients personalised level     indeed  personal approach inherent part doctorpatient relationship central aspect precision medicine  new invention  however  new biomedical information might add substantial information beyond signs symptoms previously observable  term precision medicine implies novelty concept  incorporation wide array individual data  including clinical  lifestyle  genetic biomarker information

while aspects relevant  description precision medicine leaves open number questions    cannot precision medicine distinguished related terms    precision medicine actually begin    target achievements underlying concepts idea precision medicine    stratification patients translate better healthcare    precision medicine really viewed end point novel stratification patients  implied  rather greater whole

processing deep phenotyping data
how large scale data used precising medicine  i e  integrated converted precise therapeutic interventions     interestingly  many current reports emphasise aspect data storage handling without acknowledging role analytical methods  instance  review schadt et al     describes computational environments analysis high dimensional data  statistical challenge mentioned computational complexity associated kinds data  another example  committee framework developing new taxonomy disease    postulates novel informational infrastructure requires information commons data large populations patients become broadly available research use knowledge network adds value data highlighting inter connectedness integrating evolving knowledge fundamental biological processes  however  network adds value remains unclear  even important since novel data types assessed previous step require novel approaches statistics bioinformatics  example  use next generation sequencing technologies enables genome wide investigation rare genetic variants  associating diseases requires tailored statistical methods summarise information neighboured variants  generation sequence data exploded past decade  number suggested statistical tests     general context omics data  helpful suggestions processing compiled mcshane et al     sung et al      thus  special efforts required finally use generated data clinically relevant way 
to clarify aspect  distinguish three partly sequential tracks  track   data handled without knowledge clinical end point  track   data used build models precise diagnosis prognosis disease disease outcome  track leads models predict precisely well specific patients respond treatment 
it stressed regardless chosen track  statistical models developed need confirmed use  although literature heterogeneous regard terminology  refer replication model model shown valid independent sample drawn population      estimated using internal validation techniques cross validation bootstrapping     contrast  validation model shown testing whether model valid independent sample drawn different population  depending aspects populations differ  termed temporal external validation  even though internal validation crucial first step help optimise model  temporal external validation required stringent generalisation model    
track   preprocessing data mining
in detail  track firstly includes quality control preprocessing data  quality control strongly dependent specific kind data therefore described here  details found literature     preprocessing  number aspects data type specific  example  patients genotyped genome wide screening array  allele intensities need converted genotypes using genotype calling algorithm     breathomics study  exhaled air analysed identify health related volatile organic compounds  here  proper preprocessing may include denoising baseline correction  selection intensity peaks  among techniques     specific quality control considerations given mcshane et al     
other aspects consider preprocessing general may include decisions handle missing data       decisions handle data range limits detection       harmonisation corresponding variables multicentre projects assessed coded slightly differently  example  studies fractional exhaled nitric oxide marker eosinophilic inflammation patients asthma might influenced variable techniques measurement  sampling procedures  breathing manoeuvres different types devices    
an important aspect preprocessing pertains preselection variables  since collection deep phenotyping data usually leads great amount mostly unselected data  inevitably include many variables irrelevant later modelling  problematic  since many technical examples shown irrelevant variables contain random information  so called noise  added  underlying relationships structures masked detected     example  consider an precision medicine   i r  konig et al  a  b  c  precision medicine   i r  konig et al  variable figure impact variable selection based illustration raftery dean     a  data individuals simulated  cluster three homogeneous subgroups using variables   group membership indicated     b  hierarchical cluster analysis using two variables identifies three clusters perfectly  clustering stopped distance   individuals groups   fall distinct clusters  clustering based euclidean distance used complete linkage agglomeration method  c  hierarchical cluster analysis using three additional random noise variables fails identify three groups  order individuals grouped independent true group membership  again  clustering based euclidean distance used complete linkage agglomeration method 
artificial situation data individuals simulated  individuals clustered three homogeneous subgroups  shown figure two variables considered  hierarchical cluster analysis using two variables easily identifies three clusters perfectly  figure    however  three random noise variables added dataset  cluster algorithm fails find three groups indicated dendogram figure   result  almost half individuals classified incorrectly  garbage in  garbage problem rather counterintuitive consequence data always better  planned derive patient subgroups following steps  removal noise leads stable better interpretable models  this  number statistical approaches suggested select variables within clustering procedure  example above  selection within model based clustering    able identify two relevant variables discard others  furthermore  variable selection might guided scientifically based priori knowledge possibly biologically relevant variables 
remaining track   instances helpful interrogate data previously unknown structure using data mining techniques  prominently  cluster analysis used artificial illustration figure performed potentially derive meaningful subgroups individuals  i e  patients similar profiles based similarity baseline data       successful reproducible  profiles viewed exactly novel diagnostic taxonomy alluded descriptions precision medicine given earlier  since outcome information would used  unsupervised learning approach  continue previous example gene expression asthma  genetic variables found promising candidates previous step selected taken forward subsequent re analysis data including unsupervised learning  specifically  woodruff et al     performed hierarchical cluster analysis gene expression data genes postn  within individuals asthma patients classified per high low expression  thus interpreted  high  low response  respectively 
subsequently  patients clustered according gene expression levels  high  low response  treating asthma patients anti il  antibody lebrikizumab  corren et al     demonstrated increase forced expiratory volume    distinct effect  high  low patients  thus demonstrating clinical utility taxonomy 
to fully exploit deep phenotyping data  statistical techniques used consider data multiple sources simultaneously  instance  multiple data types single nucleotide polymorphisms  copy number variations  methylation states  mrna expression  protein abundance clinical information clustered integrative consensus approaches suggested literature      
the result preprocessing data mining track might set variables profiles possibly already selected good candidates tracks   tracks chosen depends prior knowledge  specific research aim available data  instance  track appropriate representative samples patients assessed longitudinally or variable cross sectionally  bearing potential develop validate prognostic diagnostic models next  however  patients recruited randomised clinical trial  models predict treatment response may built directly  thus entering track  
track   diagnostic prognostic models
using data previous steps  models developed combine multiple predictors estimate probability particular clinical outcomes events either time  diagnostic model  future  prognostic model   hence  main difference diagnosis prognosis temporal aspect  instance  adults severe asthma recruited prospectively cohort study closed panel managed care organisation gather risk factors asthma related death among adults severe asthma  based data setting comparable access care  african american subjects increased risk death relative white subjects  however  cohort  greater severity asthma scores poorer perceived asthma control scores indicators increased mortality risk among adults severe asthma    
a number aspects considered model building  variable selection  modelling continuous variables interactions restrictions sample size  refer literature details     importantly  multitude possibilities encompassing classical machine learning approaches  statistical methods develop model chosen     context specific  since methods automatically include variable selection  yield easy to interpret models  handle large numbers variables effortlessly automatically take interactions account  overall  method best  different strengths weaknesses     furthermore  classification performances vary depending specific dataset     that  specific considerations required data multiple sources used build model  described detail ritchie et al      methods broadly fall categories multi staged meta dimensional analyses  multi staged approaches  analysis split number steps performing association analyses using two data types time       contrast  meta dimensional techniques combine data types simultaneously  examples provided analysis tool heritable environmental network associations  athena  methodology    reference    
once stable meaningful model derived  result algorithm clinical prediction rule      forecasts clinically relevant outcome disease onset mortality defined predicting variables respective weights algorithm  example algorithm nomogram individual values patient entered calculate predicted probability  example  bertens et al     present nomogram used predicting heart failure  copd combined  based individual body mass index  pack years cigarette smoking  n terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide levels    signs fluid overload  displaced apex beat  abnormal breathing sounds cough 
these models always developed fit given data optimal way  thus  actual performance estimated optimistically  need validated independent samples     therefore indicate feedback loop figures developed promising model instigates phenotyping patients performance model verified  example  tantisira et al     identified functional variant glucocorticoid induced transcript gene    patients asthma  associated substantial decrements response inhaled glucocorticoids  even though replicated findings four independent treatment trials showed reduced response inhaled glucocorticoids subjects variant allele     described variation genotype seem affect efficacy inhaled corticosteroids  ics  northern european asthmatic children young adults  population association increased risk either oral corticosteroid use asthma related hospital visits uncontrolled symptoms     relevance step replication underestimated  meaning indeed  performance validation study arguably matters  model derived little importance performs well    
furthermore  prognostic diagnostic model needs prove clinical utility  means application model helps improve adverse health outcomes  effective preventive interventive measures induced based results       without this  model may still useful informing underlying pathological mechanisms potential targets therapeutic approaches  fed back previous stages  however  render medicine precise  question whether implementing model practice potential eventually improve patient care needs investigated     previous example limited this  patients risk increasing variants still treated ics  meta analysis turner et al      data children five populations analysed interaction arg   polymorphism in precision medicine   i r  konig et al  the  adrenoceptor gene    long acting  agonist  laba  exposure asthma exacerbations  authors observed genetically increased risk exacerbation among children treated ics plus labas  treatment ics alone  ics plus leukotriene receptor antagonist  ltra  ics plus labas plus ltras  clinical relevance association shown clinical trial children persistent asthma homozygous arg   genotype randomised receive salmeterol montelukast add on inhaled fluticasone     absence school reduced montelukast compared salmeterol  greater improvements occurred symptom quality life scores montelukast salmeterol  thus proving potential role arg   genotyping personalised asthma therapy 
how prove clinical utility given model depends context  instances  identified variables may tested value predicting therapy response track  see later   however  prognostic factors also predictive treatment response     clinical impact model assessed directly claiming clinical relevance  means effect using model patients and or physicians decision making directly participant health outcomes  relative using model  needs quantified  ideally  achieved cluster randomised trial described moons et al      examples studies scarce  one illustration ongoing progressive cluster randomised trial chronic conditions management  prismatic      this  practices randomised deliver standard care use predictive risk stratification tool  prism  developed estimate risk emergency hospital admission following year  clinical utility prognostic index assessed comparing patients individual outcomes months 
it emphasised development validation diagnostic prognostic models needs reported transparent way  recommendations published transparent reporting multivariable prediction model individual prognosis diagnosis  tripod  statement     finally  order models used practice  need communicated disseminated  this  scientific publications usually suffice  easy to use algorithms made accessible together interpretation tools 
track   predicting treatment response
to achieve aim providing precise therapeutic strategies  i e   tailored targeted therapy  variables define novel taxonomy need assessed regard value predicting treatment response  two strategies might guide process developing models predict therapy response  firstly  one possibly draw prognostic diagnostic models previous stage  fact  prognostic factors sometimes assumed natural variables consider here  example  epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase status prognostic factor survival patients nonsmall cell lung cancer  also predictive response tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib first line treatment     alternatively  biological knowledge utilised directly data gathered  as  instance  evaluation monoclonal anti il  antibody mepolizumab asthma therapy  first clinical trials  mepolizumab found associated significant reduction blood sputum eosinophils  appear add significant clinical benefit patients asthma     therefore  subsequent clinical trials selected subjects refractory eosinophilic asthma  i e  sputum eosinophil percentage    least one occasion previous years despite high dose corticosteroid treatment  subgroup  mepolizumab therapy showed significant clinical effects  reducing exacerbations improving asthma quality life scores    
recently  findings expanded monoclonal antibody il  receptor  benralizumab  again  asthmatics elevated eosinophils significantly fewer asthma exacerbations  moreover  post hoc analysis patients least three exacerbations previous year  patients blood eosinophilia receiving benralizumab every weeks greater improvements relative placebo annual exacerbation rate  lung function    asthma symptoms    
as latter example shows  assessing differential treatment effects often includes investigation subgroups clinical trials find whether treatment effects differ meaningfully different patient groups  idea straightforward  methodological challenges include definition clinically relevant differential effects statistical power       furthermore  needs acknowledged therapeutic decisions informed  randomised clinical trials required  general aspects need considered context described detail literature     trials  specific study designs suggested reviewed       however  increase precision  also become increasingly challenging  required sample sizes might become difficult achieve 
again  track generates knowledge disease treatment  another feedback phenotyping patients  illustration study nonsmall cell lung cancer precision medicine   i r  konig et al  treated crizotinib  inhibitor anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene  alk      first part trial  dose escalation study  patients identified lung cancer alk rearrangement showed dramatic improvement administration drug  based finding  clinical trial modified  specifically enrolling patients tumours rearrangement  thus  feeding back information led adjusted trial showing effectiveness treatment 
finally  before  addition feedback phenotyping patients  dissemination communication taxonomy direct necessary output 
conclusions
with process definition  propose precision medicine viewed end point novel stratification patients clinical utility  rather highly sophisticated complex process  such  stratified medicine tailored therapy interim outputs process  results fed back gain knowledge thus increase precision  additionally  deep phenotyping individuals integral part process  big medical data  regard  would like stress assessing much data possible expedient  fact  need move beyond mere hunting gathering data extract relevant  that  prior knowledge confused mere intuition  selection based biological  clinical statistical evidence 
in defining term precision medicine  may helpful consider represent  process definition  emphasise precision medicine steady state specific output research flow  implies precising medicine might adequate term reflect continuous process feedback loops  ongoing efforts even precision individualisation required newly gained knowledge  possibly new data sources  yet improve accuracy  figure   
we discussed term precision medicine background obstructive airway diseases  i e  bronchial asthma  obviously  many phenotypes contribute so called asthma syndrome  considering target achievements precision medicine always effective treatment individual patient  unmet need ongoing efforts precising medicine patients uncontrolled  severe asthma  however  whether term precision medicine applicable meaningful degrees severity  even diseases  still matter debate
