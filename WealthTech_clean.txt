how doxim helping financial
institutions improve digitization 
no two companies same  flexibility key business looking offer digitalization services wealth management space  major consideration software solutions company doxim looked build client onboarding service  vice president sales scott biel  picture left   senior business development executive curly lippa  picture right  told fintech global 
doxim software services company helps financial institutions digitalize operations 
it founded   aim creating digitizing documents  storing archiving platform would streamline retrieval  demand increased  platform expanded offer document composition print mail client statements  tax slips  transaction confirmations  regulatory communications 
the company identified could even
more support businesses began capturing documents start customer engagement  led creation client onboarding  cob  solution  lippa explains  use analogy
of river  started mouth river  pretty early recognized documents storing enterprise content management solution originated somewhere else  so  kept moving
upstream  creating client onboarding solution  doxim could automate digitize documents throughout entire customer journey credit unions  community banking  wealth industries clients 
there four key problems doxim client onboarding enables businesses solve  first reducing turnaround time trim account opening couple days  traditionally  opening
an account could take number days weeks  grab and go ecosystem in  long  lippa remarks  want get market invest  week lifetime 
the next issue solution eases significantly lower document good order  nigo  rate  nigo paperwork results situations like organization may collect information consumer  comes back office  key information missed  employee number  forces document sent back out  wasting time client company  doxim research suggests average nigo rate    one doxims clients even experienced   nigo rate prior implementing cob  doxim client onboarding resolves issue automating validating information captured initial account opening stage  helping prevent delays later 
by digitizing onboarding process doxim  firms also ensure never miss important steps information needed compliance 
other organizations tried offer non flexible onboarding tools  fail work two organizations handle onboarding exact way  lippa explains  doxim differentiates offering solutions modular form  empowering clients make changes forms data collection  without needing hard code go back doxim help 
outlining need configurable tool for
client onboarding  lippa recounts  knew regulations  compliance requirements  forms change time  so  actually architected solution  recognized needed flexibility  build something today  may work tomorrow something changed process somethings changed

working legacy systems
it secret financial institutions constrained legacy systems  technology company cannot hope replace inner workings clients technology stack once  savvy technology partners recognize institution going simply flip switch get rid legacy architecture  systems deeply ingrained built upon many years  flexible technology solution works existing architecture becomes essential 
vp sales scott biel explains doxim solutions designed work organizations existing technology ecosystem  modular based apis firms pick choose bits need  rather get full package 
some biggest challenges working legacy systems  able fund projects  working legacy business models  biel said  real challenges  clients overcoming them  believe current pandemic accelerate focus prioritization projects receive ceo level within financial institutions  fact  biggest goal driving financial organizations towards digitalization businesses improve customer engagement 
were tipping point
digitizing longer option  ever  essential business process  customer expectations changing  people longer want physically go branch open account communicate banks  lippa biel agree big tech companies like amazon google changed playing field everyone  years ago customers might happy sit front someone fill reams documents  todays customers patience  accustomed ordering something today delivered tomorrow  customers impatient financial service organizations cant keep pace 
additionally  emergence covid  made need good digital customer experience even clear  scott biel said  current pandemic has  course  put stress societies large seen century  clients quickly adjust staff working remotely 
they seen unprecedented increases inbound customer service inquiries facing challenges loss ability interact customers person  business would usually conducted face face necessarily conducted online  governments regulators around world trying hardest curb impact pandemic cause financial ecosystem  us recently revealed   stimulus plan support businesses  families  loans  hospital aid 
with stimulus works  likewise  canada  uk  france  germany  australia  india  japan  spain  many countries created similar packages help businesses impacted crisis  also followed number changes regulatory parameters ease burdens companies time 
despite this  businesses still hit hard  especially heavily reliant face to  face interactions  study leesman claimed uk    workers financial services sector never worked home  businesses unprepared situation  opening eyes need robust digital channels  scott biel said  believe tipping point impetus towards companies thinking theyve got push aggressively digital path  organizations unique opportunity push forward digitization initiatives now  executive interest support initiatives all time high 
the covid  pandemic also shone light on
the fragility financial ecosystem many companies operational structures  recognizing similar incident could occur future  biel believes governments may place requirements firms robust pandemic plans place  regardless regulation  says institutions need assume something like happen need strong digital infrastructure easily deal world lockdown 
for instance  client onboarding  necessary important process wealth managers  one key areas impacted current situation  business company  customer go account opening loan origination process reliant paper intensive physical interactions branch face to face advisor  firm question cannot operate full lockdown 
we believe current events going drive mandate within organizations digital onboarding capabilities  competitors get situation  permanent fix  biel states

during pandemic  lot businesses faced increased inbound customer service inquiries challenges remotely communicate customers  doxims robust business continuity plans mean it
has prepared current scenario helped clients quickly implement solutions adjust staff working home  curly lippa explains  building years really built sustain industries businesses good times  bad times  even pandemics

is always challenge  read case studies kodak prime one  saw digital cameras coming years honest  one

as customers migrated online bookings faster lower cost  forcing industry follow  today probably almost   self service  daveus continues  see inclusion aspect  everybody travels today affordable 
with innovative api based technology offering  kidbrooke set help financial industry provide similar democratisation clients  thats small deal  wealth management used

today  company three main components platform  economic scenario generator  transaction based simulation engine decision support generator 
the expertise kidbrooke deliver clearly exemplified services provided swedens largest banks insurance companies past four years  transformations initially started pure consulting projects 
one incumbent financial institution provided with profits unit linked pension products retirement planning services many decades  however  introduction mifid ii regulations slammed regulatory obligations fulfil  needed find way
to reduce compliance pressure provide holistic financial advice service  answer conundrum enlist kidbrooke help digitalise services 
service  meant conduct in  depth demographic analyses understand consumer groups would adapt new service 
secondly  incumbent needed convince management costs introducing new solution would worthwhile  since last credit crunch  many banks insurers accrued lot money didnt feel pressured improve efficiency new ways cut costs  industrys mindset general  daveus says 
however  benefits using kidbrookes technology automate generation financial decision support advisor proposals significant ignore  kidbrooke could show enabled customers introduce consistent  high quality financial coaching advice solutions foster trust across channels

the two co founders michael kaimakliotis neil mclachlan first met   time  kaimakliotis  serves tindecos ceo  already spent years finance  began career timber
hill market making arm interactive brokers  company amazing  remembers  basically automated business trading equities equity derivatives every liquid electronic exchange around world  thomas petterfy founded still controls company hired me  chance see built    company based upon automating management financial risk

mclachlan astounded technology landscape fragmented  many different systems landscape  kaimakliotis says  integrated other  all
had fed market data  end they
still ended different analytics  someone back office would looking completely different numbers someone front office  systems based upon old technology none
of real flexibility  led armies analysts portfolio managers spending much time working excel  customising existing third party software extremely expensive took incrementally nearer target 
as soon investment manager offers clients degree customisation degree sophistication  costs go straight roof  kaimakliotis explains  want offer people portfolios really add value  need technology platform provides high degree automation  fintech global investor networks ltd profiles
they decided create platform that 
in essence software takes different view world thats generic powerful traditional system  kaimakliotis explains  use vision like ordinary system  deep vision architected work rules rather assets  ordinary system buy stock  book system thats end story  vision book rules system  rules represent systematic elements investment process  simply rules things like cash management periodic rebalancing  also quantitative strategies hedging strategies  systematic are  higher degree automation achieved  want make everything automatic  desire automation actually originated desire investment manager time focus identifying insight based investment opportunities

comparatively new enterprises tend technologically driven lack vision technology transform business clients  fail reach scope tindeco has  startups also often try sell clients ideas rather fully developed products  years ago  lot buzz startups said doing  today  business  frustrating says kaimakliotis  one way putting lot companies came may nice gui   a graphical user interface looked good  didnt core engines behind it  says kaimakliotis  built engines built gui 
but kaimakliotis says biggest challenge proved patience terms time takes deliver massive solution  also terms company culture  would easy focus one product rather grand solution pursued  kaimakliotis says  pursuing greater vision meant form team specialists many areas required relatively little overlap skillsets  make effective communication difficult 
people patient explaining expect misunderstandings occur   patient communication fails someone delivers something different expected 
he continues  people human  kind patience shared incentives  everyone company becomes part employee stock option plan  means really pulling together  mistake made  regroup look forward  trying learn mistakes
