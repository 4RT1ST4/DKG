health economics concerned issues relating scarcity resources  provides tools necessary assess efficient use available resources allocation health healthcare defined terms costs outcomes 
health services increasingly use health economic analysis guide purchasing reimbursement decisions  national institute health clinical excellence  nice  uses approach asses incremental costeffectiveness ratio  icer  technology  extra cost per extra unit benefit achieved comparing one technology another  determines whether increase cost justified sufficient increase effectiveness  decisions made based a remedi cost effective investment
threshold level icer  purpose adapt costeffectiveness analysis inform investments development decisions 
applying health economics early development cycle
costeffectiveness analysis typically conducted product developed i e  demand side  case technology yet developed  early stages development  nature product uncertain effectiveness studies conducted  argue adoption health economics early development i e  supply side  help inform investment decisions indicate products greatest potential 
here  describe simple threshold approach problem supply side analysis  termed headroom method  estimates maximum cost technology brought market still considered costeffective  examples regenerative products 
the headroom method
the headroom method simply looks potential clinically defined market  instead asking  costeffective technology be  ask  would costeffective works well one would hope  words  optimistic assumptions made incremental effectiveness proposed treatment best alternative  ask  cost would new technology costeffective  gives maximum potential cost new treatment  including development costs   factoring health service savings 
if cost low investment funds channelled elsewhere  course  reverse true new technology might still fail despite adequate headroom  example  might turn less effective expensive hoped  novel competing remedi cost effective investment
alternatives may emerge  however  headroom method lower risk embarking investment doomed outset 
the headroom method provides framework support investment decisions  stages summarised below

effectiveness available treatments effectiveness  including side effects complications  must clearly described  particular  side effects could potentially avoided new treatment identified  e g  te solution repair complex hernias would avoid adhesions infections  complication current treatment 
headroom analysis
the headroom analysis involves two aspects 
  establishing effectiveness gap room improvement
in effectiveness current best treatment that
which new technology might plausibly achieve 
  calculating headroom maximum incremental cost  maximum additional cost compared current best treatment  new technology could still considered cost effective  based optimistic plausible estimates
of effectiveness technology assessed 
firstly  must cover basic health economics principles 
  incremental costeffectiveness ratio  icer 
costeffectiveness analysis aims quantify icer  extra cost per extra unit benefit comparing one technology another remedi cost effective investment
most often done cost per quality adjusted life year  qaly  basis  discussed below  
the comparator always current gold standard treatment  improvement performance  terms costeffectiveness  support reimbursement new technology 
an icer calculated using incremental cost    incremental effectiveness    give cost per additional unit effectiveness  incremental cost per qaly  equation   
equation   icer   c   e
  quality adjusted life year  qaly 
a qaly measure accounts quantity quality life generated healthcare  quantity measured years quality measured health utilities  health utility measures strength individuals preference particular health outcome  measured scale   death    perfect health  greater preference particular health outcome result greater utility health outcome  year perfect health worth i e  qaly equal year perfect health  incremental qaly gain  qaly  function improvement health utility  utility  duration improvement sustained  equation   
equation   qaly   utility x duration time  years  health state
calculating headroom
now calculate headroom    maximum additional cost new treatment comparator  current gold standard  new treatment deemed costeffective  rearrange equation equation   substitute icer wtp remedi cost effective investment
 willingness pay  threshold  where  wtp threshold maximum threshold icer i e  maximum healthcare provider wtp qaly  uk  assume   per qaly  effectiveness gap maximum additional benefit could obtained new treatment  see below  
equation   max cost   wtp threshold x max qaly estimating maximum qaly the
effectiveness gap
when current treatment suboptimal  effectiveness gap estimated  conditions treatments ineffective large proportions patients significant side effects  maximum potential increase effectiveness current treatment may used optimistic assumption  specifically looking side effects could eliminated new treatment identified definition clinical problem 
two steps required calculate effectiveness gap  maxqaly  
  health utility associated current treatment
having defined clinical problem existing treatment possible identify clinical outcome new treatment improve  next  necessary identify health utility associated clinical outcome  health utilities identified literature database utilities held tufts university  not  utility values established using formal methods 
finally  define effectiveness gap  since know true effectiveness new technology  assume optimistic scenario  the new technology returns patient perfect health  health utility    subtract utility value identified   remedi cost effective investment
  estimation duration improvement effectiveness
the next step identify maximum potential duration clinical benefit expected new treatment  difference life expectancy  duration improvement clinical benefit taken account i e  duration side effects current treatment would abolished new treatment  likely difference life expectancy must included calculation 
now populate equation calculate headroom  maxcost  
return investment  roi 
for technologies appear headroom  continuing development investment would appear justified  stage  interest focussed whether technology potential succeed  bought market  roi may affected rarity condition occurs economies unable support high cost remedies  revenue generated function headroom  likely cost volumes  equation    max cost headroom c expected cost production 
equation   revenue    max cost c  x volume
conclusion
following headroom analysis  two possibilities exist 
  investor make intuitive decision invest based the
outcome headroom method 
  investor perform formal value investment analysis 
the framework discussed provides structure investment decisions  headroom analysis useful barrier misguidedly investing technologies unlikely costeffective  remedi cost effective investment
there little chance technology could marketed price would keep maximum incremental cost    threshold technology attract investment  noted value applying methods dependent planned technologies aimed third party payer 
as development proceeds important revisit economic analysis new information regarding likely effectiveness technology becomes available  continual economic assessment various stages development enable accurate predictions products cost effectiveness hence market potential 
however  difficulties arise technology nears market  uncertainties major barrier adoption technology requirement provide sufficient evidence effectiveness  evidence

regenerative medicine tissue engineering maturing translational phase labbased experimental disciplines nascent industry  projected clinical demand indicates within next decade industry need responsively economically provide diverse range rm products  many incorporate living cells  large market  transformation driving need robust manufacturing systems cellbased products meet stringent regulatory requirements imposed medical product manufacture 
the requirement manufacture living products rm applications poses significant new challenges  challenges revolve around complexity living product sensitivity environmental conditions  living cell constant state change response environment  therefore maintaining product quality requires precise remedi manufacture
process control  cell products always incorporate degree heterogeneity due different microenvironments manufacturing process  furthermore  complexity living cell defies comprehensive definition  measurement product quality usually based average population values surrogate markers  i e  critical gene protein expression  best indicative critical product attributes  therapeutic efficacy  safety  
many solutions technologies developed conventional biologics manufacture cannot applied cell therapies  large volume suspension bioreactors well characterised cell line production readily adapted culture adherent cell types required cellular products  cells themselves  rather culture byproduct  product  conventional downstream purification also limited use  greater sensitivity therapeutic cells difficulty product measurement enforce greater reliance process understanding control guarantee product safety efficacy 
achieving controlled characterised manufacturing process cell based therapies requires development new technologies  tools techniques  well transfer manufacturing experience diverse older industries  addition technical challenges outlined  manufacturing equipment  processes facilities must compliant good manufacturing practice  gmp   stringent regulatory framework controlling therapeutic product manufacture 
the remedi method

complexities specific rm industry  generic methods industries  particular process automation systematic process improvement methods  instructive approaching challenge 
process automation key mechanism achieving controlled standardised processes many manufacturing industries  automation also enables scaleout production predictable process variation therefore predictable process costs  marked contrast scaleup manual laboratory operator processing  systematic process improvement methods  six sigma approach  developed electronics automotive manufacturing order understand control sources process variation thereby reduce rate defective products

achieving gmp standards cell manufacture
as automated process development work progressed  consideration given challenge production system could meet regulatory requirements clinical production  regulatory authorities demand stringent validation equipment facilities used production therapeutic products human application  therefore  transition facilities automation nongmp applications gmpvalidated equipment requires careful consideration processing machine  well surrounding laboratory environment  furthermore  segregation individual cell types  whether cell lines individual patient cells  pivotal maintaining quality cell tissue based products  crosscontamination occur individual patient samples  would potential risk adverse reactions due transfer patient disease one cell another  even negative immune reactions due body recognising cells nonself  however  terms manufacturing multiple autologous therapies concurrently  cost complete segregation patients cells dedicated incubators biosafety cabinets may make cost therapies prohibitive 
from regulatory perspective  full qualification reagents source materials required  together appropriate manufacturing controls ensure consistency product quality cell lot  environmental monitoring utmost importance  air quality  water quality  laboratory design personnel training compliance critical product safety  example  fda standards classify critical area  i e  area product exposed environmental conditions manipulations  requiring percubicmetre particle count   size range   larger  furthermore  quality control  qc  plan also needs put place ensure proper manufacturing oversight  well provide following functions  remedi manufacture examination various production components   cfr   a    review approval production procedures  testing procedures acceptance criteria   cfr   c    assessment clinical batch based cumulative review completed production records relevant information   cfr   a   cfr    cfr     and investigation initiation corrective actions unexpected results errors occur production   cfr   a   cfr

the way forward
once addressed  current biggest challenge manufacturers cell tissuebased therapies development representative potency assays evaluate final product  according recent fda guidance document  potency assays must specific  quantitative  meet predefined criteria  include appropriate standards controls  fully validated measure identity strength active ingredients  therefore  due inherent heterogeneity cells themselves  requirements met product fully defined manufactured consistent standards  consistency rely strong quality systems controlling product manufacturing process itself  one way combat problem concept quality design  qbd

efficacy
proper characterisation understanding cell function important factor determining whether cellbased therapy function effectively vivo  however  complete characterisation cell processes still unknown  difficult accurately predict every consequence particular cell placed within patient  efficacy tests always cellspecific and  ideally  test function cell required vivo situation  cases  vitro assays used surrogate measures  measures often provide sensitive useful data vivo trials animal model  clinical endpoints defined early stage allow proper evaluation cellbased therapies patient trials  cellbased treatments  endpoints patientspecific  relative age patient  well related disease diagnosed account existing complications affect treatment outcome  however  due complexity several clinical applications  optimal efficacy measurements may evolve time due improved clinical information available inform decision  quantifying efficacy measurements another challenge product developers  focussed upon appropriate specific functional assays identified  regards vitro testing  sensitivity of remedi characterisation
measurements always depend detection system used  therefore design functional assay  identifying key output requirements  likely challenging sensitivity detection system itself 
purity manufacture
many scientists consider cell viability primary factor determining cellular effect advanced therapies implanted body  measured using various simple assays  well sophisticated measures cell metabolic activity providing quantitative data  however  viability percentages simply measure many cells alive  many cells actively metabolising playing productive role environment  terms advanced therapies  identifying cell phenotype  function perhaps mode action critical specific clinical applications  biomarkers may important distinguishing different cell phenotypes  always provide correlation cell function  therefore  terms cellbased therapies  cells act body might important immunophenotype vitro  cellular morphology also used analyse cell populations using various microscopy techniques determine cells appear true phenotype 
to meet product specifications  cell number cell viability measurements must accurate specific product dose determined  however  accuracy cell counts also quite variable  manual automated systems  therefore  automated cell counting systems several advantages manual counting  improvements still need made  note  final product acceptance range carefully considered limitations machine must taken account  may include tolerancing specifications  well factoring measurement system errors may contribute misleading data  extremely narrow range might cause products rejected due inaccuracies rather actual product failure  remedi characterisation
combination products
combination products include two separately regulated components  i e  drug device  biologic device  drug biologic  drug device biologic  regenerative medicine applications  involve combination device biologic  e g  scaffold seeded cells  therapies require stringent regulatory processes risk contamination crosscontamination higher products undergo terminal sterilisation step 
safety

efficacy
here  suitable test methods depend upon component combination product main therapeutic action  example  drugloaded scaffold  rate scaffold degradation dissolution play primary role determining efficacy  whilst tissuebased product composed biomaterial cells  components likely play key role product function  thus  number complementary techniques used fully assess product efficacy  further  selection measurement tools preference given techniques enable product assessed environment representative site intended use  remedi characterisation
purity manufacture
as cellbased products  combination products contain biologic undergo tests assess cell viability phenotype  here  use conventional testing methods may limited difficulties arise isolating cells components product  thus  test methods require isolation cells practical  e g  fluorescent markers microscopy   devices  quality combination products require assessment structure composition  here  important assess impact components product structure composition  e g  cells may obstruct voids scaffolds time modulate composition surrogate matrices  therefore  imaging spectroscopy techniques sufficient contrast resolve component combination product useful
