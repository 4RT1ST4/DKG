at one end  deeptech start ups  including longevity start ups  suffering lack access relevant levels seed investment

as consequence  start ups forced deal angel investors  creates growth gap phenomenon known death valley    deeptech start ups survive stage growth seed financing beginning revenue generation even rounds 
meanwhile  end  extreme abundance significant assets held preserved bank accounts comparatively stable derivatives scale tens trillions  instance  tremendous volume money scale least trillion currently stored swiss bank accounts negative interest rates  illogical phenomenon mod  ern financial world itself

thus  major source disproportions comes issue illiquidity
